# Deep Learning for accurate predictions of Grain Boundary (GB) Diagrams
This repo provides three single-task deep neural networks to predict GB properties:

* Impurities or solutes adsorption (*a.k.a* segregation) at GB, *Γ*<sub>Ag</sub>;

* Free volume of GB, *V*<sub>Free</sub>;

* Excess of structural disorder at GB, *Γ*<sub>Disorder</sub>.

We have demonstrated the success of deep learning models in the construction of 
"complexion diagrams" of GB, the presence of GB property diagrams as functions of 
temperature and bulk composition.
